# Linear-Regression-and-K-fold-crossvalidation

### Python Version:
Python 3.6

### Libraries Version:
Numpy – 1.14.3
Pandas – 0.23.0
Matplotlib – 2.2.2


### Code Explanation:
The code can be explained in four steps.
1. Data initialization: Here I have read the data separately for A vector and Y vector. In Y, I have assumed -1 for Iris-setosa, 0 for Iris-versicolor and 1 for Iris-virginica
2. Linear Regression and Classification:
Here I have calculated the beta values and then I have used that beta to predict the classes. Also, I have calculated the error and accuracy of that.
3. N-fold:
Here I have calculated the average error and accuracy for different number of folds.
4. Error Visualization:
Here I have plotted the graph for multiple N values Vs error value.

### How to run the code:
1. Place the text file with the data in the same location
2. Run the file Main.py as
Python Main.py
